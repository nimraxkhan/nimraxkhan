Security Operations | Detection Engineering | Threat Analysis

I build and document defensive security systems.

My focus is blue team operations — log analysis, intrusion detection, network monitoring, and security automation. I design hands-on labs that simulate real SOC environments and emphasize measurable detection capability, structured investigation, and operational clarity.

This repository reflects practical execution — not theory.


🎯 Mission

To operate and continuously improve within a Security Operations Center environment by:

Detecting adversary activity through log and network analysis

Triage and escalation with structured investigative methodology

Automating repeatable SOC workflows

Contributing to resilient, measurable security operations

📂 Projects
🔎 Detection Lab

A structured security monitoring environment where I:

Configure and test firewall rules

Deploy and tune Snort IDS

Capture and analyze live traffic

Validate encrypted VPN routing

Perform packet-level inspection and filtering

Document findings using SOC-style reporting


⚙️ SOC Automation Project

Integrate alert pipelines with case management

Simulate incident response scenarios

Create structured investigative documentation

Optimize repeatable response actions


🔐 Philosophy

Security is not noise collection.
It is disciplined signal detection, structured response, and continuous improvement.
